# Voices of Our Ancestors: Ancestral Blog Platform

This is a client-side web application created to share oral histories, traditions, cultural experiences, and survival stories of Black Indigenous people in the Americas. Users can post anonymously using symbolic aliases, contribute content, and reflect on shared lived experiences.

## How to Run the Application

1. Download or clone the project folder.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. No server or backend is required — everything runs locally via JavaScript and localStorage.

## Features

- Tree-themed interface with moving background and spiritual aesthetic
- Anonymous blog post system (title, content, tags, images)
- Upload images to embed or submit for gallery review
- Golden thread connections (category = solid, tag = dotted)
- Admin/monitor review dashboard for post approval
- Sort/filter by category and tag
- Hover-only delete icons with role-based permissions
- Carousel of 21 ancestral images with full-size lightbox view

## Development Reflection

This project was built to honor ancestral wisdom, lived truth, and community healing. The biggest challenges included:

- Implementing golden thread connections between posts
- Ensuring posts do not overlap and scale dynamically
- Getting canvas layering and background transparency just right
- Managing image uploads while allowing for gallery review
- Dynamic sizing of post and pictures

Each challenge was overcome by testing DOM logic, layering z-index elements, and listening to the flow of the platform’s purpose.
